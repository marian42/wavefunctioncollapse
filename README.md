# Wave Function Collapse

An infinite, procedurally generated city, assembled out of blocks using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm with backtracking.
Currently, there is no gameplay, you can only walk around and look at the scenery.

Keyboard Controls: WASD for walking, Space to jump, Shift to run, Ctrl to jetpack.  
XBOX Controls: Left Stick for walking, right stick for looking around, A to jump, LB to run, RB to jetpack

Flight mode: Use M to toggle between flight mode and normal mode. In flight mode, you fly across the world, without any controls.
